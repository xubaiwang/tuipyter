Make a Jupyter TUI by putting together the awesome [runtimelib](https://github.com/runtimed/runtimed) and [r3bl](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core).

## Why not other tools

- Jupyter in browser: A browser is too heavyweight for Vim users.
- Jupyter Desktop: heavyweight, and electron is not prepared for Wayland
- euporie: feature rich and workable, but feels laggy and blocking. execessive UI elements
